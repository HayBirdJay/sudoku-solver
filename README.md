# sudoku-solver
My very first coding project: a python sudoku solver

I am attempting to create a sudoku solver where users can input an incomplete sudoku board which the program will complete
I am encountering an issue where I want the user to be able to check they accurately input the board before it's solved but I can't seem to figure out how to do that
